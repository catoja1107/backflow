				<h2 class="title"><strong>Backflow Basics</strong></h2>
				<h3><strong>What is backflow?</strong></h3>
					<p>Backflow refers to the undesired, reverse flow of used or dirty water back into the clean water distribution system. Backflow occurs at a point in the system called a cross-connection. At the cross-connection, it is possible for the non-potable or used water, to come into contact with the pure, potable water. Backflow can cause contamination in the customer's personal or business system that could eventually pollute the public water supply.</p>
				<h3><strong>How can I prevent backflow from occurring?</strong></h3>
					<p>Backflow is caused by shifts in the system's pressure and can be prevented by installing a backflow prevention device at the cross-connection point. These devices are often attached to the customer's water meter or outdoors on irrigation systems. There are five basic types of backflow prevention devices that are used.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:number;">
					<li>Air Gap</li>
					<li>Atmospheric Vacuum Breakers</li>
					<li>Pressure Vacuum Breakers</li>
					<li>Double Check Valve Assembly</li>
					<li>Reduced Pressure Zone Backflow Preventers (RPZ)</li>
				</ul>
					<p>Backflow Testing & Installation, LLC installs all five types of backflow prevention devices, both residentially and commercially.</p>
				<h3><strong>What laws and regulations are there about backflow?</strong></h3>
					<p>The Federal Government and the state of Georgia have developed laws and regulations regarding backflow and water contamination. In 1973, the Safe Water Drinking Act was passed on the federal and state levels. Georgia passed the Rules for Safe Drinking Water in 1977, stating  “ A supplier of water or any person having Control of facilities which may cause the Contamination of a public water system has the responsibility to prevent water from Unapproved sources or any contaminants from entering the public water system.” In 1983, the Department of Natural Resources amended this rule and required that all public water distribution systems develop backflow prevention programs.</p>
				<h3><strong>Who needs backflow prevention? How do I know if I need a backflow prevention device?</strong></h3>
					<p>Backflow prevention devices can be installed on any type of cross connection, but are commonly used on irrigation systems and fire sprinklers. Many businesses, as well as homeowners, are required to install backflow prevention devices. Residentially, the devices are commonly attached to sprinkler irrigation systems. Soft drink machines are also required to be fitted with a backflow prevention device. If you received a letter from your local water authority about backflow, give us a call today!</p>
				<h3><strong>Does my device need to be tested? How often?</strong></h3>
					<p>Yes, backflow prevention devices can break or wear out, so they need to be tested every year. The State of Georgia requires that devices be inspected annually by a certified tester. Backflow Testing & Installation is fully licensed and Georgia certified to perform these types of inspections. We will also submit a report to the local county agency.
